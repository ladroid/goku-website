# Evolving Expressions: The Trail of Transformations in Goku Engine

Hello again, wonderful world of game enthusiasts! It’s me, back with yet another chapter of my narrative on the Goku game engine. The path of development has, once again, unfolded new leaves, some expected, some surprising, but all leading towards making Goku smoother and more pleasurable to interact with. 

## Diving Deeper into the Core

While the GUI held its charm, I've recently decided to shift my focus more towards refining the core of the Goku game engine. The aim is to provide a seamless and comfortable experience to the creators and players alike. It’s like smoothing out the canvas to ensure every stroke of creativity finds its perfect expression.

## A Virtual Home: The Official Website

Oh, and guess what? We now have an official home on the web for Goku! I’m super excited to introduce our official website, a cozy corner where I’ll be sharing updates, news, and some hands-on examples to play with. The website graciously speaks Japanese, French, German, and Spanish. Although, I must apologize if there are any linguistic missteps—I gave it my all!

## Unveiling the New Blossoms

Now, let’s meander through the new blossoms in the garden of Goku:

1. **Animation Class Refinement**: Now, you can set a row from a single PNG file for animations, no more juggling with multiple PNG files!
2. **PointLight Perfection**: The PointLight has seen a total makeover, becoming more user-friendly and ready to illuminate your game scenes.

4. **Spot Light Feature**: Shine a spotlight exactly where you need it with this brand-new feature.
5. **Button Design Choice**: Now, you have the choice to go for rounded or non-rounded buttons. A small touch, but it's all in the details, right?
6. **Simple Profiler**: A new feature to help you analyze the performance of your game, making optimization a breeze.
7. **GEvent for Keyboards**: Transitioned to using GEvent for a more streamlined keyboard event handling.
8. **Dialogue System Enhancement**: It’s no longer just about adding text; rendering and drawing are part of the dialogue narrative now.
9. **Neovim & VSCode Integration**: For the code-editing aficionados, integration with Neovim and VSCode have been introduced(for more details please read this [article](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html)).
10. **Examples Galore**: Not only have the existing examples seen improvement, but more examples have been added to broaden your horizon.

## Looking Beyond the Horizon

With every modification, the Goku engine is morphing into a more robust and friendly companion for game developers. It’s about making every interaction smooth, every feature accessible, and every creation a joyous journey. 

Each step forward is a step closer to a community where ideas flow effortlessly and creations resonate with the heartbeats of endless gamers out there. The road ahead is long, but with a companion like Goku, it’s bound to be an enthralling adventure.

I’m here, with a heart full of anticipation, to continue sharing this exhilarating journey with each one of you. The tales of Goku are far from over; they are just getting more exciting. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy coding!
